# To Do List

### Aims

- Create a to-do list that allows you to add tasks and projects, filter by projects and filter by due date.
- Allow tasks and projects to be added to local storage

### Future Ideas

- Allow the user to delete projects.
- Allow the user to edit tasks.
- Have a completed projects list.
- If doing this again, I would implement local storage from the start, rather than as an add on at the end.
- Tidy up the JS and make it a little easier to understand.
- Add some animations to make the tasks move slightly when you hover over them.
